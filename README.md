**Author:** Stuart MacGowan ([smacgowan@dundee.ac.uk](mailto:smacgowan@dundee.ac.uk))

## Overview
This repository contains research code and data used to analyse the impact of ACE2 variants on SARS-CoV-2 infection. The primary focus is on exploring how missense variants in ACE2 influence interaction with the SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein and their potential contribution to genetic risk factors in COVID-19.

## Research Paper
The detailed analysis and figures related to this study are available in the paper titled:
- "Missense variants in ACE2 are predicted to encourage and inhibit interaction with SARS-CoV-2 Spike and contribute to genetic risk in COVID-19". 

   This work is available as a [preprint on bioRxiv](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.05.03.074781v1).
